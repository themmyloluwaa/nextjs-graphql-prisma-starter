# NextJS Graphql Prisma Starter

This is a project that contains basic setup files needed to start developing web applications using nextjs on the client and graphql (graphql-yoga) on the backend.

The content of this readme aims to guide you through the files and folders in the project.

- There might be packages or folders and files that you do not need, please remove it from the respective package.json file and remove the imports in the script.js file.

The graphql approach for developing the server follows the code-first approach.

Nexjs is used on the client and apollo graphql is used to communivate with the graphql server.

Graphql-Yoga is used on the backend. This gives us access to using express and apollo server features. It also supports file upload.

Bootstrap is added to the nextjs application to help with styling the application. You can find this import in \_app.js file.

This readme would be updated as more project needs arise.

## Happy coding!! From your favorite code hokagei - <CodeKagei>.
